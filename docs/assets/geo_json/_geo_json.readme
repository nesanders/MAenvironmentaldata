Note:

The geo_json files in this directory were generated by [MapShaper](http://mapshaper.org/) based on shapefiles from the MA Executive Office for Administration and Finance's MassGIS shapefiles ([Towns](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/townsurvey.html), [Watersheds](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/watrshds.html)).  They were simplified using the Visvalingam / weighted area algorithm to ~10% for filesize reduction purposes.
