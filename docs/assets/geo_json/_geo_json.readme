Note:

The geo_json files in this directory are based on shapefiles from...

* The Office of Geographic Information (MassGIS), Commonwealth of Massachusetts, MassIT ([Towns](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/townsurvey.html), [Watersheds](http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-serv-and-support/application-serv/office-of-geographic-information-massgis/datalayers/watrshds.html)). 
* The US Census ([MA 2017 Census Block Groups](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_blkgrp.html))

Note that, according to https://wiki.state.ma.us/display/massgis/Arc3WMS, the MassGIS files are provided in EPSG:26986 format: http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/2249/ whereas most web applications expect coordinates in the EPSG:4326 SRS.  The ogr2ogr tool (implemented online at https://ogre.adc4gis.com/) was used to convert the shapefles between the two systems.

The `_simple` files were simplified using [MapShaper](http://mapshaper.org/) and the Visvalingam / weighted area algorithm to ~33% (towns) and ~10% (watersheds) for filesize reduction purposes.
