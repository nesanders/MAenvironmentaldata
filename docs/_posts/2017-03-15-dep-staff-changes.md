title: Staff Changes at the MADEP Over Time
---

A key element of the evolution of the role and effectiveness of environmental regulation in Massachusetts is the staffing of our most prominent environmental agency, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The analysis presented below draws from the [MA DEP staffing]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/MADEP_staff.html) and [budget data]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/MassBudget_environmental.html) in the [{{ site.data.site_config.site_abbrev }} database]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data/index.html).

We can better understand the staffing picture at DEP by breaking the staff down by role types within the agency, focusing on the critical roles of environmental analyst, engineer, regional planners, and program coordinator.  Indexing these numbers to 2004 levels, we see relatively constant employment (and some growth) for analysts, while the most technical staff, engineers, have steadily declined by a cumulative total of more than 20%. The planning staff stands at only about half what it was in 2004.  The ranks of program coordinators rose about 10% from 2014-2016, though this rise corresponds to a sharp decrease in experience level for this role (shown below).

Perhaps the strongest indicator of seniority and experience in the agency is the average salary level for staff in each role type. After adjusting for wage inflation, this measure largely mirrors position level.  Particularly for the key positions of environmental analyst, engineer, regional planners, and program coordinator, the charge below shows a steady increase in average earnings from about 2007-2013, but an accelerating decline in seniority since then.
