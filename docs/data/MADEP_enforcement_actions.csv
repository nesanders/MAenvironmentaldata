2008,1/31/08,"MassDEP entered into a Consent Order with the town of Edgartown (and the Martha's Vineyard Refuse Disposal & Resource Recovery District) for Solid Waste violations at the Meshacket Road Landfill in Edgartown. The specific violations involve the failure to complete the assessment and closure/capping of the unlined municipal landfill. At issue is the fact that through the review of the landfill closure certification report that had been submitted in 2002, MassDEP determined that the assessment/closure/capping of the unlined landfill had not been completely performed. Also, a 2-acre area located at the site was not included in the original landfill assessment, closure and capping plans that the parties implemented 1997-2001 pursuant to a MassDEP Order of 5/15/95. MassDEP's review of recently-submitted information found that this 2-acre area had been used as the location of a temporary solid waste transfer station established at the landfill while the District established a larger ""central facility"" elsewhere on the island. At the time, the landfill was going through its ""original"" assessment, closure and capping. At that time, it was thought that this 2-acre area did not contain any solid waste.

2014,12/1/14,"MassDEP's Environmental Strike Force (ESF) assisted the Office of the Attorney General in the investigation of National Water Main of Canton. The investigation arose out of a whistleblower lawsuit filed in Norfolk Superior Court in 2012. The investigation by ESF found that National Water Main brought materials back to its Canton location that were removed from sewer lines and holding tanks. The material was dumped on the ground and into an illegal underground holding tank that leaked the contents to the ground resulting in a discharge of pollutants to the groundwater. National Water Main also cleaned their trucks and the contents of the trucks at the Canton site, without collecting the wastewater and disposing it at a wastewater treatment facility resulting in other Clean Water Act violations.

The Albrights own a residential property at 270 Boston Street in Topsfield. MassDEP was requested to take over enforcement matters on this case by the local conservation commission because the Albrights had failed to fully comply with the local (and multiple) enforcement orders, and extensions (of time) for restoring a vernal pool, intermittent stream and surrounding forested bordering vegetated wetland. The original violations occurred in August of 2007 when the Albrights clear cut, excavated and graded an area of their property to build a large pond surrounded by manicured lawn. This work, in fact, had altered the bank of an intermittent stream and approximately 28,000 square feet of BVW containing a vernal pool. As such, this violation resulted in the issuance of two local orders, a restoration plan and schedule for the work. Another order was issued locally in September 2008. Although work pursuant to the plan was performed, portions of it were in noncompliance with the plan and schedule. Additionally, after planting, during the beginning ""grow in"" and monitoring period, the entire area of vernal pool, BVW and buffer zone was mowed. In October of 2008 the locals issued the Albrights specific written notification about their obligations under the previous orders and that any future mowing within wetlands jurisdiction required authorization. October 2009 monitoring reports and site visits confirmed that the ""grow in"" and hydrology of the vernal pool and surrounding BVW were successfully supporting the functional goals of the restoration. However, a July 2010 monitoring report documented that the entire area of vernal pool and BVW had again been mowed. In October 2010, the local agent observed evidence of this, the area had again been recently mowed, a violation. Subsequent negotiations with the Albrights and the TCC regarding compliance with the restoration plan and additional planting to restore forested canopy in the area proved unsuccessful. Under today's Order, the Albrights are required to bring the site into compliance with a revised comprehensive restoration plan that includes significant additional planting to restore a forested canopy and long term monitoring. The Albrights will pay $10,000 of the Penalty and the remaining $22,000 will be suspended pending compliance with the terms.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,32000.0,['Topsfield']

In 2009, MassDOT was issued an Order of Conditions by the Amesbury Conservation Commission and a 401 Water Quality Certification by MassDEP for reconstruction of a portion of Route 110 in Amesbury (a portion is also located in Salisbury). The Order and Certification authorized alteration of 4,855 square feet of bordering vegetated wetland 3,918 square feet of land under water, 410 linear feet of bank, and 24,200 square feet of riverfront area in Amesbury. As part of the alternatives analysis during the permitting process, project plans were subject to multiple revisions to avoid and minimize alterations to wetland resource areas. In March 2011, while traveling from an inspection of another site, MassDEP staff observed that construction on a portion of the project in Amesbury appeared to be out of compliance with approved plans. During a subsequent full site inspection, MassDEP staff found that, contrary to the approved plans, the activities performed filled and altered a total of 780 linear feet of bank (370 more than authorized), 10,404 square feet of BVW (5,549 square feet more than authorized) and 4,900 square feet of LUW (982 square feet more than authorized).

2015,10/21/15,"MassDEP issued a Unilateral Order to The Michael C. Coakley Living Trust Trustee for Wetland Protection Act violations at 5 Packard Street in Woburn. In September 2009, Coakley filed a 'request for determination of applicability' or RDA, proposing to install a drainage pipe in the location of the existing stream flowing across the site, to add fill to the area, and to connect the pipe to the existing 42-inch culvert at the street abutting the site. The Woburn Conservation Commission (WCC) issued a negative determination of applicability, in essence, finding that the site did not contain an area subject to protection under the Wetlands Protection Act or a buffer zone. MassDEP, however, intervened and appealed this decision, which ultimately resulted in MassDEP issuing a final superseding determination of applicability in 2010. MassDEP found that the intermittent stream channel located on site is in fact, connected to an upgradient and downgradient bordering vegetated wetland. Further, that wetlands resource areas and buffer zone to resource areas exist on site, and that the proposed work would take place within the wetland resource area. This meant a filing of a Notice of Intent (NOI) was required before work could begin. That MassDEP decision remains valid to date and will expire in April 2017 (pursuant to the permit extension act). On 9/10/14, the WCC issued an enforcement order to Coakley for ""earthwork on site including piping a channel"" without a valid Order, and also ordered Coakley to cease and desist. The WCC further required that the Wetlands alteration be corrected and the site returned to its original condition. Shortly thereafter, the WCC issued another enforcement order, citing the same violations and requiring that Coakley restore the site to its original condition, or, file an NOI by 10/9/14.  In response to the second Order, Coakley filed an NOI proposing installing a drain manhole to connect the existing 24-inch pipe from the abutting property on the west and to install seventy-four (74) linear feet of 42-inch pipe to connect to the existing 42-inch pipe and headwall at the abutting street on the east (portions of the work already completed and to be authorized retroactively). On 1/23/15, the WCC issued an approval of an Order for the project with a finding that piping of the stream would result in seventy-four (74) linear feet of bank alteration. Then, on 2/4/15, MassDEP intervened and appealed the WCC Order because of the project's inability to comply with the performance standards for bank.

2015,4/2/15,"MassDEP executed a Consent Order with a $28,125 Penalty involving the city of Quincy for Wetlands violations at 122 Russell Park in Quincy.  In 2009, as part of an appeal of a local order of conditions, MassDEP reviewed work proposed by Quincy at Faxon Field including the installation of a 12-inch equalization pipe under the Russell Park roadway.  After MassDEP requested additional supporting hydrological information for the pipe, Quincy withdrew the pipe from the proposed work.  MassDEP notified Quincy that the pipe would be subject to the filing of a new notice of intent if Quincy wanted to construct the pipe in the future.  In July of 2009, MassDEP issued a superseding order of conditions for the remaining proposed work at Faxon Field.  In July 2012, MassDEP became aware that Quincy constructed the pipe without filing the required notice.  On 10/2/12, MassDEP executed an Order with Quincy for hazardous waste, water pollution control and wetlands violations.  That Order required Quincy to file an ""after the-fact"" Notice for the installation of the pipe including the supporting hydrological calculations which Quincy did in December 2012. Quincy's own conservation commission issued an Order of Conditions, and MassDEP intervened and took jurisdiction because the pipe discharged into an area serving as a compensatory flood storage area for alteration to bordering land subject to flooding. During further review, MassDEP also found that the installation of the pipe had altered approximately 200 square feet of bordering vegetated wetland and 15 linear feet of bank.  On 6/12/13, MassDEP requested additional information from Quincy with a 70-day deadline for submittal. In October of 2013, after not receiving the information, MassDEP communicated with Quincy about the obligation to produce the information and was assured the information would be submitted in a timely fashion. As of 11/4/14, MassDEP had not received the information from Quincy, any request for additional time to respond, or any communication concerning the pipe installation.  Today's Order requires that within 30 days, Quincy submit specific information including a detailed ""as-built"" plan for the pipe and explanation of how the alteration of BVW, Bank and BLSF meet the performance standards.
